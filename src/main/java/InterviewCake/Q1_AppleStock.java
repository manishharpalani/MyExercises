// Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich.
// Maybe trading Apple stocks will.

// Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:
//
// The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock.
// A higher index indicates a later time.
// So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am and $550 at 11:00am, then:
//
// stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;
//
// Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit
// I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
//
// For example:
//
// int[] stockPricesYesterday = new int[]{10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9};
//
// getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
// // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
//
// No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell.
// You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
